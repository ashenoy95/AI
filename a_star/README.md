#### A simple working implementation of the A* search algorithm

The program searches for the shortest path between cities (nodes) along highways (edges) in Euclidean space.

The heuristic function used is Euclidean distance as it is monotone.

Input to the program is in the form of a yaml file that contains the nodes (cities), edges (highways), start node and goal node. (sample input is included)

Requirements:
PyYAML
